Prerequisites
- pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client
- Azure AD app registration with least-privilege read access to the target site/library
- App-only client credentials (prefer certificates in production)

Required environment variables (do not hardcode secrets):
  SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID
  SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET
  SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL

Optional:
  SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY_TITLE (default YourLibraryTitle)
  SHAREPOINT_TEMP_DIR (default temp_download)
  SHAREPOINT_OUTPUT_ZIP (default output.zip)

Security notes
- Never commit real client secrets. Use environment variables or a secret store.
- Prefer app-only auth with least privilege. Do NOT disable MFA to unlock password auth.
